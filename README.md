# Sentiment Analysis Voting

## Project Description
Sentiment Analysis Voting - Analyzes social sentiment to influence votes.

## Smart Contract Address
`0x3686A90E95Ed3E5828C8859FAc2Dc0D1432Fd307`

## Features
- Blockchain-based voting system
- Influenced by sentiment analysis
- Minimalist Solidity smart contract
- No external dependencies or constructors
- No input fields

## Installation
To interact with the smart contract, ensure you have the following:

1. **Metamask**: Installed and configured with the appropriate blockchain network.
2. **Remix IDE**: For testing and deploying Solidity contracts.
3. **Solidity Compiler**: Ensure you have Solidity installed for local development.

## Usage
You can deploy and interact with the smart contract using Remix IDE:

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new Solidity file and paste the smart contract code.
3. Compile and deploy the contract using the specified address.
4. Interact with the contract using the available functions.

## Smart Contract Code (Example)
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SentimentVoting {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint256 public positiveVotes;
    uint256 public negativeVotes;
    
    function vote(bool _isPositive) public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted.");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        
        if (_isPositive) {
            positiveVotes++;
        } else {
            negativeVotes++;
        }
    }
    
    function getVotes() public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (positiveVotes, negativeVotes);
    }
}
```
